# Multi-Blockchain Wallet in Python

## Background

Building a system that creates a HD wallet that supports all assets including Crypto and classic assets like stocks.

I used ethereum and Bitcoin Testnet as well.

### Use
This python wallet has the potential to manage billions of addresses across 300+ coins, giving you a serious edge against the competition.

The process includes:

- Generate a mnemonic phrase
- Derive the wallet keys
- Link the transaction-signing libraries
